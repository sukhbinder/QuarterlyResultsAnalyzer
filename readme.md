#Quarterly Financial Results Analyzer

Every quarter when results come out, I spend suffiecint hours looking at the financial results of the stocks I am tracking to elicit nagging comments from wifey. So developed this simple python scripts which does the analysis and generates me the PDF which i email to myself to look at during office communute.

Hope someone else will find it as useful as I do. Will put the results on my blog.
