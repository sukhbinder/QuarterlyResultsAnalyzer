#Quarterly Financial Results Analyzer

Every Quarter when results come out, I spend sufficient hours looking at the financial results of the stocks I am tracking to elicit nagging comments from wifey. So developed this simple python script which does the analysis and generates me the PDF which I email to myself to look at during office commute


Hope someone else will find it as useful as I do. Will put the results on my blog.
